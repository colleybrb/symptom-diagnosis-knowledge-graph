### What it does
* Loads symptoms, diagnosis, count of occurence.
* Pushes information to Neo4j
* Queries for where the symptom has the highest occurence.
* Parses diagnosis to link for Merck manual.


### Notes
* Good walk through for Neo4j in python
* Could be used with a knn and more details for case based reasoning (IMO).
